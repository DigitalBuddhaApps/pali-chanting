Requesting the Going Forth (`pabbajjā`_ 出家)

The ordinand then takes his place on the floor at the far end of the
monastic assembly to receive the Triple Robes (三衣) from his parents or
senior relatives or members of the congregation who are patron to the
ordination. The ordinand bows three times and kneeling extends his
arms (palms together in a gesture of prayer) towards his parents.

Taking the Triple Robes on his forearms, he walks on his knees to where the
Upajjhāya (Preceptor 戒師) is seated.

The ordinand offers the Triple robes to the Preceptor

the ordinand picks up the offering and offers this to the Preceptor before
prostrating himself three times. (with the five elements of prostration: two
knees,the two forearms, and the forehead touching the floor at the same time)

The preceptor returns the triple robes to the ordinand who stands humbly before
him (feet together and head slightly lowered), with hands together in a gesture
of prayer and chants the following words:

  Instruction:Basic objects of Meditation (Pāli: `mūlakammaṭṭhāna`_) (根本業處 มูลกัมมัฎฐาน)

The ordinand sits down with his legs folded to one side.
Having placed the set of robes in front of himself,
the Preceptor instructs the applicant in the Triple Gem,
advises him to develop conviction in it as it his refuge and
reminds him of the purpose and benefits of ordination. After that he
teaches the applicant the five basic objects of meditation, and after
explaining their meaning and the purpose of contemplating them, recites
them in the forward and reverse orders. The applicant repeats the
tacapañcakakammaṭṭhān after-him word-by-word as follows.

-After taking meditation instruction, the applicant should kneel up and allow
the preceptor to take the shoulder cloth from the robe bundle and put it over
the applicant's head.
The applicant should then extend his forearms towards the Preceptor to receive
the rest of the robe bundle. He should then back out from the assembly on his
knees, stand and retreat to the place prepared for changing.

sitting cloth on the floor between him and the the preceptor then presents him
with a tray of offerings and makes a five-fold bow to him three times before
requesting the refuges and precepts with the following words:

homage to the Triple Gem which the applicant will repeat after him.
