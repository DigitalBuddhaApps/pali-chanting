Requesting the Going Forth (`pabbajjā`_ 出家)

The ordinand then takes his place on the floor at the far end of the
monastic assembly to receive the Triple Robes (三衣) from his parents or
senior relatives or members of the congregation who are patron to the
ordination. The ordinand bows three times and kneeling extends his
arms (palms together in a gesture of prayer) towards his parents.

Taking the Triple Robes on his forearms, he walks on his knees to where the
Upajjhāya (Preceptor 戒師) is seated.

The ordinand offers the Triple robes to the Preceptor

the ordinand picks up the offering and offers this to the Preceptor before
prostrating himself three times. (with the five elements of prostration: two
knees,the two forearms, and the forehead touching the floor at the same time)

The preceptor returns the triple robes to the ordinand who stands humbly before

Having placed the set of robes in front of himself,
the Preceptor instructs the applicant in the Triple Gem,
advises him to develop conviction in it as it his refuge and
reminds him of the purpose and benefits of ordination. After that he
teaches the applicant the five basic objects of meditation, and after
explaining their meaning and the purpose of contemplating them, recites
them in the forward and reverse orders. The applicant repeats the
tacapañcakakammaṭṭhān after-him word-by-word as follows.

-After taking meditation instruction, the applicant should kneel up and allow
the preceptor to take the shoulder cloth from the robe bundle and put it over
the applicant's head.
The applicant should then extend his forearms towards the Preceptor to receive
the rest of the robe bundle. He should then back out from the assembly on his
knees, stand and retreat to the place prepared for changing.

platform where the ācāriya or teacher is sitting. The applicant spreads the
sitting cloth on the floor between him and the the preceptor then presents him
with a tray of offerings and makes a five-fold bow to him three times before
requesting the refuges and precepts with the following words:

ukāsa vandāmi bhante, sabbaṃ aparādhaṃ khamatha me bhante,
mayā kataṃ puññaṃ sāminā anumoditabbaṃ sāminā kataṃ puññaṅ

homage to the Triple Gem which the applicant will repeat after him.

Thus ordination is to be<br /> made by four complete Announcements.<br /> From the conclusion of the ordination the applicant is<br /> one having the state of Upasampadā and has communion<br /> (saṃvāsa) with the Sangha. The ācariya having taken the<br /> bowl from him, the new bhikkhu prostrates three times<br /> before the Upajjhāya and sits in his place within the assembly of bhikkhus.<br /> Now it is the time for the Upajihāya or the ācariya to<br /> teach Anusāsana (an admonishment for bhikkhus)<br /> to the new bhikkhu. This may be done either within the<br /> assembled bhikkhus or at a prepared place outside the<br /> assembly, either while sitting or while standing. It should<br /> be done for all new bhikkhus at the same time if more than<br /> one has been ordained.Permitted to be told by the Lord to<br /> one having the Upasampadā are these four supports together with<br /> the four things never to be done.<br /> At the end of the Anusāsana,<br /> the new bhikkhu should acknowledge it by saying<br /> āma bhante (Yes, Sir),<br /> and then prostrate three times.<br /> Then the new bhikkhu takes a seat within the assem-<br /> bly. In case there are offerings for the Upajjhāya and the<br /> ācariya or for the other bhikkhus there, he should receive<br /> them and present them to the Upajjhāya and so on.<br /> Having ﬁnished with the offerings, the new bhikkhu<br /> comes back to his place. While the assembled bhikkhus<br /> chant the Anumodanā passages (acknowledgement of the<br /> merit-making) and the blessing passages, he should ded-<br /> icate the merit arising from being ordained to deceased<br /> members of his family, etc., at the same time pouring out<br /> water. During the stanzas beginning with Yathā… ,<br /> he pours all the water from a small ﬂask into<br /> a little bowl (signifying that he gives all of the merit to oth-<br /> ers in less fortunate births). At the end of the Yathā… pas-<br /> sages, when all the bhikkhus chant the stanzas So Attha-<br /> laddho… (for a single ordination) or Te Atthaladdhā…<br /> (for the collective ordination, including novices), and<br /> the Bhavatu Sabba… the new bhikkhu<br /> is to join his hands in the gesture of respect until the end<br /> of the chanting.<br /> Here ends the Ordination Procedure style: esāhaṃ</p></div><div class="_3x-2" data-ft="&#123;&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;H&quot;&#125;"><div data-ft="&#123;&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;H&quot;&#125;"></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><form rel="async" class="commentable_item collapsed_comments" method="post" data-ft="&#123;&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;]&quot;&#125;" action="/ajax/ufi/modify.php" onsubmit="" id="u_0_k"><input type="hidden" name="lsd" value="AVot8lZq" autocomplete="off" /><input type="hidden" autocomplete="off" name="ft_ent_identifier" value="223274111152516" /><input type="hidden" autocomplete="off" name="data_only_response" value="1" /><div class="_sa_ _gsd _fgm _5vsi _192z"><div class="_37uu"></div></div><div class="uiUfi UFIContainer _3-a6 _4eno _1blz _69ad _65_9 _5pc9 _5vsj _5v9k" id="u_0_j"></div></form></div></div></div></div></div></div> --></code></div>
